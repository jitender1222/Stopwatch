# Stopwatch

This is a stopwatch project in which the user can `start` `pause` and `reset` the time which is shown in the display.

**Tech used:**

Html

Css

JavaScript

The main goal to build this project is to improve my basic knowledge in javascript.

In this I used Set interval and add event listner method to build this project.

By making this project i get a understanding on how to use `SetInterval` method.

Initially i face difficulty to use setInterval then I read about it on google and able to make this.

**Time Taken**

It took me around 3hrs to complete this.
